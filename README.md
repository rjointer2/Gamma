## Description

üîçGamma (A MERN stack application) can help drive productivity, Return on Investment (ROI) and efficiency in every industry in this era of digitalization. Creating a chat application is always an interesting thing to do. And it is a good way to learn a lot because you are creating some interactions with your application. In-app chat typically means private, bidirectional chat and direct messaging between or more people within a software application. As you know with the release of a few technologies, we can create such an application without any hassle. It is easier than ever. So, we have created a real-time chat app that is powered by Socket.IO and Mern Stack. This is a web application that allows multiple users to have a private and public chat. This app allows one to one chat online and its fast and easy to use, because it's very user friendly. 

### Chat Delivers on the Need for Direct Communication
Designers are leading the charge on how people are connecting and building relationships with the internet, providing a new layer of communication and decision making through smart chat app design. I hope to showcase a few in-app messaging examples from real companies that are solving real problems.

üíª Below is the deployed application:

## User Story

```
AS a user , I want to chat with my friends in a realtime  
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Use React for the front end.
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
Is installable
Have a polished UI.
Be responsive.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Include authentication (JWT).
Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Both the server and react will start and populate as localhost in browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
